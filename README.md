# VoxelSrv
VoxelSrv is a voxel game inspired by Minecraft, where you can build, mine and ~~craft~~ (not implemented yet).
I'm creating it to learn Javascript and just have some fun.
It's still unfinished, maybe someday it will be playable. For now it's multiplayer-only, but I plan to add Singleplayer too.
