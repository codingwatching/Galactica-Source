# VoxelSrv
VoxelSrv is a voxel game inspired by Minecraft, where you can build, mine and ~~craft~~ (not implemented yet).
I'm creating it to learn Javascript and just have some fun.
It's still unfinished, maybe someday it will be playable. For now it's multiplayer-only, but I plan to add Singleplayer too.

- [Changelog](https://github.com/Patbox/voxelsrv/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

I'm open to any PR or suggestions, as long as they don't make it less playable/break more than needed.
